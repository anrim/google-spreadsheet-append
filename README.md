# Append row to Google Spreadsheet

Node.js module that makes it simple to append new rows to a spreadsheet.

* Integrates with [Google Spreadsheet API v3](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/spreadsheets/#adding_a_list_row)
* Authorization is done by OAuth 2.0 and JSON Web Token (JWT).
* Uses ES6 generator functions for simple flow control.

See more instruction here in this great blog post: [Accessing Google Spreadsheets from Node.js](http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2014/03/04/accessing-google-spreadsheets-from-node-js/).

## Installation

  	npm install google-spreadsheet-append


## Create a Service Account and share spreadsheet

1. Create a new project in [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com)
2. APIs > Enable Drive API & SDK
3. Credentials > "Create new Client ID"
4. Download private key and convet to PEM format: openssl pkcs12 -in downloaded-key-file.p12 -out your-key-file.pem -nodes
5. Copy the email address in Credentials > "Service Account"
6. Share a spreadsheet with service account email address
7. Copy the file ID from the spreadsheet URL: "https://docs.google.com/a/gmail.com/spreadsheets/d/{fileId}/edit"

## Example usage
  	var moment = require('moment');
  	var Spreadsheet = require('google-spreadsheets-append');
  	var spreadsheet = Spreadsheet({
    	auth: {
    		email: "abc@developer.gserviceaccount.com",
    		keyFile: "privatekey.pem"
    	},
    	fileId: {fileId}
  	});

  	// append new row
  	yield spreadsheet.add({timestamp: moment().format("M/D/YYYY HH:mm:ss"), email: "a@a.com"});

## Run tests

Set environment variables (see steps above):
```
export EMAIL=<service account email>
export KEYFILE=<key file>
export FILEID=<spreadsheet file id>
```

then run the tests:
```
npm test
```

If you want to enable debug output, then run the tests like this:
```
DEBUG=spreadsheet,google-oauth-jwt npm test
```

If you want to pass the private key in single-line string in the `KEY` variable, then first add newlines like this and copy the output.
```
awk 1 ORS='\\n' privatekey.pem
```

```
export EMAIL=<service account email>
export KEY=<key string with newlines>
export FILEID=<spreadsheet file id>
npm test
```
